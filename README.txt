This repo will contain cleaned code used to generate estimates of DTP1 routine immunization coverage, as well as code used to align estimates of children who have never received a dose of DTP (no-DTP) with those of other relevant health indicators, and assess the degree of overlap between them.

This repo is associated with the following publication:
Haeuser, E.; Nguyen, J.Q.; Rolfe, S.; Nesbit, O.; Fullman, N.; Mosser, J.F. Assessing Geographic Overlap between Zero-Dose Diphtheria–Tetanus–Pertussis Vaccination Prevalence and Other Health Indicators. Vaccines 2023, 11, 802. https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11040802

Materials will be added to this repo soon.
